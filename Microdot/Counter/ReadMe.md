- Microdot library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

## Usage

1. Run the counter application:

   ```
   python counter.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8008`. You will see the counter value and two buttons to increment or decrement it.
