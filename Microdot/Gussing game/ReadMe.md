# Guessing Game

This is a simple High Low Guessing Game web application built with Microdot. The user has to guess a number between 1 and 100, and the application provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features

- **Guessing Game**: The application prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, the application provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Guess Counter**: The application keeps track of the number of guesses made by the user.
- **Color Indicator**: The application displays a colored circle that represents the feedback. Red indicates a low guess, yellow indicates a high guess, and green indicates a correct guess.
- **New Game**: The user can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.

## Usage

1. Run the Guessing Game application:

   ```
   python guessing_game.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8008`.

3. Guess a number between 1 and 100 and submit your guess using the provided input field and submit button.

4. The application will provide feedback on your guess and display the number of guesses made.

5. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the number or start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.
