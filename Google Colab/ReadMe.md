```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage.io import imread
```
The code imports the necessary libraries, `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting and `skimage.io.imread` for reading an image.

```python
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamedwardhahn/Data_Sci/main/dataset/train/cat/download.jpg'
```
The variable `url` stores the URL of an image.

```python
im = imread(url)
```
The `imread()` function is used to read the image from the specified URL and store it in the variable `im`.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.imshow(im)
plt.axis('off')
```
These lines create a figure with a size of 20x10 inches, display the image `im` using `imshow()`, and turn off the axis ticks and labels using `axis('off')`. This shows the image without any axis annotations.

```python
im.shape
```
This line outputs the shape of the image `im`, which represents the dimensions of the image (height, width, and number of channels).

```python
plt.imshow(im[:,:,0],cmap='gray')
```
This line displays the image `im` by selecting only the first channel (red channel) using `im[:,:,0]` and using the grayscale colormap (`cmap='gray'`). This shows the image in grayscale.

```python
plt.imshow(im[:,:,1],cmap='gray')
```
This line displays the image `im` by selecting only the second channel (green channel) using `im[:,:,1]` and using the grayscale colormap. This shows the image in grayscale, emphasizing the green channel.

```python
plt.imshow(im[:,:,2],cmap='gray')
```
This line displays the image `im` by selecting only the third channel (blue channel) using `im[:,:,2]` and using the grayscale colormap. This shows the image in grayscale, emphasizing the blue channel.

```python
plt.imshow(im[:,:,:],cmap='gray')
```
This line displays the image `im` by selecting all channels using `im[:,:,:]` and using the grayscale colormap. This shows the image in grayscale, combining all the channels.

```python
plt.imshow(im[120:150,:,1],cmap='gray')
```
This line displays a cropped version of the image `im` by selecting a specific range of rows (120 to 150) and all columns, and using only the second channel (green channel). This shows a cropped portion of the image, emphasizing the green channel.

```python
W = np.zeros((100,100,3))
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines create a new image `W` with dimensions 100x100 and 3 channels (RGB). The image is filled with zeros using `np.zeros()`. Then, the image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a black image.

```python
W = np.ones((100,100,3))
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines create a new image `W` with dimensions 100x100 and 3 channels (RGB). The image is filled with ones using `np.ones()`. Then, the image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a white image.

```python
W[:,:,0] = 1
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines modify the image `W` by assigning a value of 1 to the first channel (red channel) using `W[:,:,0] = 1`. Then, the modified image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a red image.

```python
W[:,:,1]

 = 1
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines modify the image `W` by assigning a value of 1 to the second channel (green channel) using `W[:,:,1] = 1`. Then, the modified image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a yellow image (combination of red and green).

```python
W[:,:,2] = 1
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines modify the image `W` by assigning a value of 1 to the third channel (blue channel) using `W[:,:,2] = 1`. Then, the modified image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a cyan image (combination of green and blue).

```python
W[0:10,:,0] = 1
W[40:50,:,1] = 1
W[70:80,20:25,2] = 1
plt.imshow(W)
```
These lines modify the image `W` by assigning different values to specific regions. The first line assigns a value of 1 to the first channel (red channel) for the first 10 rows. The second line assigns a value of 1 to the second channel (green channel) for rows 40 to 50. The third line assigns a value of 1 to the third channel (blue channel) for a specific rectangular region. Then, the modified image `W` is displayed using `imshow()`, resulting in a multi-colored image.
