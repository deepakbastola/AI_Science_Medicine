# Continuous Function Animation

This Python script generates an animated visualization of a continuous function using Matplotlib. The function `f(x) = x^2` is chosen as an example, and the animation demonstrates the concept of epsilon-delta definition for continuity.

## Getting Started

To run this script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import matplotlib.style as style
```

2. Define the function:
```python
def f(x):
    return x**2
```

3. Set the point of interest and calculate the function value at that point:
```python
a = 2.0
fa = f(a)
```

4. Generate the x values and compute the function values:
```python
x = np.linspace(a - 1, a + 1, 400)
y = f(x)
```

5. Create the figure and axes:
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
```

6. Set the labels for the axes:
```python
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('f(x)')
```

7. Plot the function:
```python
line, = ax.plot(x, y)
```

8. Add annotations, lines, and texts to the plot as described in the script.

9. Define the `animate` function to update the plot for each frame of the animation.

10. Set the animation style:
```python
style.use('fast')
```

11. Create the animation:
```python
ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=200, interval=200, blit=True)
```

12. Display the animation:
```python
plt.show()
```
